End term assignment for Tim &amp; Jefrey's petstore

Authors: Etixz &amp; H3AR7B3A7
Property of: Erasmus highschool of Bruxelles

The assignment was to create a webshop for two given owners and model customers.
The shop had to have a way to sort products, store them to a cart and create an order.
Several other functionalities could only improve our mark once the MVP had been met.
We had about 3 days to present the results.

This was an early introduction to Spring boot and in no way represents what a real web shop should look like.

Special thanks to: Swasse
